A color scheme for Sublime Text 2. It's made for web developers who working with standard web programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, XML, SQL, etc. This theme is a work-in-progress for now, I will continuously refine it. In the future, there is a chance that I will add support for other languanges as well.

And here are some screenshots:
